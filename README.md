# rustlings ü¶Ä‚ù§Ô∏è

My solutions of the rustlings exercises.

## Resources

- [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html) - The most comprehensive resource for learning Rust, but a bit theoretical sometimes. You will be using this along with Rustlings!
- [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html) - Learn Rust by solving little exercises! It's almost like `rustlings`, but online

## Usage

Find instructions to install and run in the [original repo (version 5.2.1)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/tree/5.2.1).

## Contributing

Any proposals to make the solutions better are welcome.

If you would like to help make rustlings itself better, you can do so in the [original repo](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings).
